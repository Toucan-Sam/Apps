# About
This is just a list of apps that I personally have/use on various machines. Hopefully to make your life a little easier. Lots of it you'll probably know. Some of it you may not. Basically a list of personal recommendations. I may not always currently be using something on this list, but I've used it at least once for a significant amount of time. Also a list for me to find things when I wipe my machine(s).

**Full Disclaimer:** Some of this software may damage or modify your device in unintended ways. I will try to highlight anything that is a particular risk, but all responsibility is ultimately yours.


# Windows
## General System
* [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) - Replaces Windows search completely with an instant search. Actually find things again!
* [PowerPlanSwitcher](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH556L3) - Laptops - Windows 10 removed the ablity to switch power plans depending on wether using a wall plug or battery. This restores that.
* [7Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) - Still using WinRAR? WinZip? Just use Windows Explorer to open zip files? Fix that. This opens any compressed files that you'd actually want to open.
* [Malwarebytes (aka MBAM)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) - In my personal experience, this has been excellent at finding and removing less than desirable things from your system. Also very few false positives which means it isn't removing stuff it just doesn't like, but is actually dangerous. That being said, the Windows 10 built-in anti-virus is often more than sufficient.

## Browsers
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - Anything is better than Internet Explorer (or Edge). Chrome is a great replacement.
* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) - Firefox is an excellent privacy-concious browser. And since Quantum (v59) it's a lot faster than it used to be.
* [Opera](https://www.opera.com/) - Built on Chrome, but includes a built in ad blocker and free VPN features. Really good if you want a little extra from Chrome.

### Extensions
* [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/ublock/)) - Currently the best ad blocker on the market as far as I can tell. Tons of features. Completely changes how you see the web. **WARNING:** If you get excited and block everything (you should!) you may need to temporarily disable uBlock Origin as it will block buttons on websites sometimes. Thankfully you can whitelist sites to not use the ad blocker if you run into any issues.
* [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/#download) - Replace LastPass! Free open-source password manager that will change your life. Apps avaliable for Android and iPhone. 
* [EnhancedSteam](http://www.enhancedsteam.com/) - If you play games you use Steam. If you use Steam, install this. It will tell you the current and best prices for games. Definitely worth checking out.
* [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylus/)) - Skins the web! Want a dark version of your favorite website? This is how you do it.
* [Chrome Extensions in Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/install-chrome-extensions/) - Unfortunately even though Opera is built on Chrome, sometimes not all extensions are avaliable. Install this and fix it!

## Gaming
* [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/about/) - It's Steam. If you play games you probably already have this installed.

## Communication
* [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) - It's Discord. If you play games you probably already have this installed. If you don't play games, it's still awesome for connecting to communities about anything and everything.
* [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net/home/) - Make Discord better! Install plugins and themes finally! *Pro-tip:* Any time Discord updates you'll probably have to reinstall this. It won't break Discord though.
* [TeamSpeak](https://www.teamspeak.com/en/downloads) - The best. Before Discord anyway. Still handy to have.
* [Quassel](https://quassel-irc.org/) - IRC. Remember mIRC? This is a way better version. Not overly fancy, but a solid client with the ability to install it in client/server mode. Run the server somewhere else and connect to it from your laptop or your phone.
* [TCChat](https://gettc.xyz/) - Twitch chat client. Great for being involved in multiple chats without actually having to keep all the individual streams open.

## Productivity
* [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - Just a text editor. Except it's tabbed. And fast. Oh, and it's got way more features than you'll ever use, but when you do you'll thank me.
* [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) - FTP/S and SFTP client. Super handy for the everything.
* [SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html) - Lightweight PDF reader. That's all. If you're not editing PDFs get rid of Adobe or Foxit and use this. It's perfect.
* [Remote Desktop Manager](https://remotedesktopmanager.com/) - Incredibly useful tool that merges RDP, SSH, and a ton of other remote access tools into a single, easy to use, interface.
* [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/) - Portable SQL tool. MySQL, MSSQL, PostgreSQL. All in one tool. Keep it easy.
* [VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html) - Premiere virtualization tool. VirtualBox is a great open-source/free alternative.

## Media
* [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/) - The **ONLY** media player you'll ever need. Seriously. If it doesn't play in VLC it's either broken or a scam.
* [Google Music Desktop Player](https://www.googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com/) - If you subscribe (or even use) Google Music, this is a godsend. Google Music without a browser. Sort of.
* [NZBGet](https://nzbget.net/) - If you know what an NZB is you want this. If you don't, nothing to see here.
* [µTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/) - My preferred torrent client (for Windows), though I don't use torrents much anymore. **Pro-tip:** Use the link below. µTorrent is not what it used to be unfortunately.
* [Pimp My µTorrent](https://clips.twitch.tv/NastyGoodBobaChocolateRain) - Removes the annoying ads in µTorrent. Saves you $5/year which shouldn't even be a thing. Nothing to install. Just visit the website, click the button.

## Network
* [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) - An absolutely excellent and easy to use VPN service. It's not cheap but there are often good deals (Google for coupons!). Works on Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Linux.
* [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/) - A second and also awesome VPN experience. Same deal. Google for coupons. Well worth the money though.
* [OpenConnect](https://github.com/openconnect/openconnect-gui/releases) - A great open-source AnyConnect client. Save profiles! Use 2FA automatically! Woo!

# Android
## Ad Blocking
* [Blokada](https://blokada.org/index.html) - **THE** ad blocker for Android. No root required. Install this.

## Authentication
* [Authy](https://authy.com/) - Great 2 Factor Authentication app. Save your 2FAs to an encrypted cloud.

## Communication
* [Signal](https://signal.org/) - The only properly free, no metadata gathering, privacy protecting, instant messenger. Text, pictures, voice and video calls.
* [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) - Nice lightweight messenger with no advertising. Owned by Facebook though.
* [Facebook Messenger Lite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.mlite&hl=en) - Facebook Messenger without all the bloat. Much smaller app size and a cleaner interface without extra junk.
* [Facebook Less Crap](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/bullshified-version-facebook-okay-to-t3586318) - Replaces the official Facebook app. Removes ads, sponsored posts, and a bunch of other junk. *Pro-tip:* You MUST uninstall any official Facebook apps to use this. The link also provides Messenger and Messenger Lite apps that are compatible.

## Vehicle
* [Android Auto](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.projection.gearhead) - Extra simple interface for driving. Navigation, calls, and music. Nothing more, nothing less.
* [Fuelio](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kajda.fuelio) - Keep track of fuel and other vehicle expenses. Also supports multiple cars and multi-device syncing is in beta.

## Gadgets
* [Mi Band Tools](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.zdenekhorak.mibandtools) - If you have a Mi Band (any version) you should have this app. The Mi Band is a great fitness bracelet (And only $30 bucks!) but Mi Band tools makes it worth having. Better notifications and tons of stuff you don't get in the official app.

## Productivity
* [Out of Milk](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.capigami.outofmilk) - No ads. Simple shareable lists. Great for not having to ask your partner to send you a list of what you need at the grocery store or anywhere else really.
* [AlarmDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.splunchy.android.alarmclock) - Simple alarm clock app but easily the best. Supports schedules, multiple alarms, and my personal favorite flip to snooze! Just flip your device over and it snoozes automatically. No need to even look at the screen.

## Lifestyle
* [BiteSnap](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.bite.biteapp) - Really neat app for keep track of your diet. Take a picture and it'll guess what it is and it's usually pretty close.

## Network
* [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) - An absolutely excellent and easy to use VPN service. It's not cheap but there are often good deals (Google for coupons!). Works on Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Linux.
* [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/) - A second and also awesome VPN experience. Same deal. Google for coupons. Well worth the money though.

## Media
* [Yatse](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.leetzone.android.yatsewidgetfree) - Kodi remote control. Multiple devices, nice big screen, and easy to use. If you use Kodi at home, you should have this.
* [Simple Gallery](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplemobiletools.gallery) - This is what QuickPic used to be. It's a gallery with all the features you want and nothing you don't. No ads, no junk features you'll never use, and not privacy invasive. Install this, use this. It's better than whatever you're using, I promise.

## Customization
* [Navbar Apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.damianpiwowarski.navbarapps) - Lets you use a transparent Navbar on Android. No root required. Great for phones with no physical buttons. I also don't understand how this isn't a normal feature, but whatever. Here it is.

## Root
**WARNING:** These apps require advanced knowledge of Android and require a custom recovery. Don't even look at this section if the thought of losing your phone for a couple of days while you fix it makes you nervous.
* [Magisk](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/official-magisk-v7-universal-systemless-t3473445) - Allows for systemless root. Add tons of features to your device without breaking Google Pay.
* [Xposed (Systemless)](https://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/unofficial-systemless-xposed-t3388268) - This is the version compatible with Magisk above. Allows for all sorts of in-app trickery.

* [Call Recording](https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-5/themes/app-enable-call-recording-boot-t3634292) - Requires a OnePlus 5/5T. If you have one (and are using OOS) this enables native call recording even if the feature isn't enabled in your region.
* [Single User Mod](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-single-user-mod-t3639486) - Removes (hides) the additional user/profiles features of Android. No guests need to use my phone and I don't need a work profile.
