# About
This is just a list of apps that I personally have/use on various machines. Hopefully to make your life a little easier. Lots of it you'll probably know. Some of it you may not. Basically a list of personal recommendations. I may not always currently be using something on this list, but I've used it at least once for a significant amount of time. Also a list for me to find things when I wipe my machine(s).

Full Disclaimer: Some of this software may damage or modify your device in unintended ways. I will try to highlight anything that is a particular risk, but all responsibility is ultimately yours.


# Windows
## General System
* [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) - Replaces Windows search completely with an instant search. Actually find things again!
* [PowerPlanSwitcher](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH556L3) - Laptops - Windows 10 removed the ablity to switch power plans depending on wether using a wall plug or battery. This restores that.
* [7Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) - Still using WinRAR? WinZip? Just use Windows Explorer to open zip files? Fix that. This opens any compressed files that you'd actually want to open.

## Browsers
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - Anything is better than Internet Explorer (or Edge). Chrome is a great replacement.
* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) - Firefox is an excellent privacy-concious browser. And since Quantum (v59) it's a lot faster than it used to be.
* [Opera](https://www.opera.com/) - Built on Chrome, but includes a built in ad blocker and free VPN features. Really good if you want a little extra from Chrome.

### Extensions
* uBlock Origin ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/ublock/)) - Currently the best ad blocker on the market as far as I can tell. Tons of features. Completely changes how you see the web. WARNING: If you get excited and block everything (you should!) you may need to temporarily disable uBlock Origin as it will block buttons on websites sometimes. Thankfully you can whitelist sites to not use the ad blocker if you run into any issues.
* [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/#download) - Replace LastPass! Free open-source password manager that will change your life. Apps avaliable for Android and iPhone. 
* [EnhancedSteam](http://www.enhancedsteam.com/) - If you play games you use Steam. If you use Steam, install this. It will tell you the current and best prices for games. Definitely worth checking out.
* Stylus ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylus/)) - Skins the web! Want a dark version of your favorite website? This is how you do it.
* [Chrome Extensions in Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/install-chrome-extensions/) - Unfortunately even though Opera is built on Chrome, sometimes not all extensions are avaliable. Install this and fix it!

## Gaming
* [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/about/) - It's Steam. If you play games you probably already have this installed.

## Communication
* [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) - It's Discord. If you play games you probably already have this installed. If you don't play games, it's still awesome for connecting to communities about anything and everything.
* [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net/home/) - Make Discord better! Install plugins and themes finally! Pro-tip: Any time Discord updates you'll probably have to reinstall this. It won't break Discord though.
* [TeamSpeak](https://www.teamspeak.com/en/downloads) - The best. Before Discord anyway. Still handy to have.
* [Quassel](https://quassel-irc.org/) - IRC. Remember mIRC? This is a way better version. Not overly fancy, but a solid client with the ability to install it in client/server mode. Run the server somewhere else and connect to it from your laptop or your phone.
* [TCChat](https://gettc.xyz/) - Twitch chat client. Great for being involved in multiple chats without actually having to keep all the individual streams open.

## Productivity
* [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - Just a text editor. Except it's tabbed. And fast. Oh, and it's got way more features than you'll ever use, but when you do you'll thank me.
* [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) - FTP/S and SFTP client. Super handy for the everything.
* [SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html) - Lightweight PDF reader. That's all. If you're not editing PDFs get rid of Adobe or Foxit and use this. It's perfect.
* [Remote Desktop Manager](https://remotedesktopmanager.com/) - Incredibly useful tool that merges RDP, SSH, and a ton of other remote access tools into a single, easy to use, interface.
* [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/) - Portable SQL tool. MySQL, MSSQL, PostgreSQL. All in one tool. Keep it easy.
* [VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html) - Premiere virtualization tool. VirtualBox is a great open-source/free alternative.

## Media
* [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/) - *THE* only media player you'll ever need. Seriously. If it doesn't play in VLC it's either broken or a scam.
* [Google Music Desktop Player](https://www.googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com/) - If you subscribe (or even use) Google Music, this is a godsend. Google Music without a browser. Sort of.
* [NZBGet](https://nzbget.net/) - If you know what an NZB is you want this. If you don't, nothing to see here.

## Network
* [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) - An absolutely excellent and easy to use VPN service. It's not cheap but there are often good deals (Google for coupons!). Works on Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Linux.
* [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/) - A second and also awesome VPN experience. Same deal. Google for coupons. Well worth the money though.
* [OpenConnect](https://github.com/openconnect/openconnect-gui/releases) - A great open-source AnyConnect client. Save profiles! Use 2FA automatically! Woo!
