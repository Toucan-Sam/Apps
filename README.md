# About
This is just a list of apps that I personally have/use on various machines. Hopefully to make your life a little easier. Lots of it you'll probably know. Some of it you may not. Basically a list of personal recommendations. I may not always currently be using something on this list, but I've used it at least once for a significant amount of time. Also a list for me to find things when I wipe my machine(s).

Full Disclaimer: Some of this software may damage or modify your device in unintended ways. I will try to highlight anything that is a particular risk, but all responsibility is ultimately yours.
